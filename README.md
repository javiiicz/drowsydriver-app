## Introduction
Welcome to **Drowsy Driver**, a cutting-edge software solution aimed at improving road safety by detecting signs of driver fatigue in real-time. This project showcases the capabilities of **Drowsy Driver**, offering a glimpse into how technology can reduce the risk of accidents caused by drowsy driving.

While the full features of the app are still under development, you can learn more and explore the project at [www.drowsydriver.co](http://www.drowsydriver.co).

## The Webpage
The official **Drowsy Driver** website provides an overview of how the project works and the technology behind it. Here, youâ€™ll find details on the science of driver fatigue detection and the future ambitions of the project, including how we aim to make the technology widely available to drivers everywhere.

Although the site is live, please note that the demo functionality is limited to local environments at the moment. If you're interested in testing it out, youâ€™ll need to run the app on your own machine.

## How to Run the Demo Locally

Currently, the **Drowsy Driver** demo is available only for local use, meaning it wonâ€™t function directly from the website. 

The local demo utilizes your webcam to analyze facial features and detect early signs of drowsiness. It uses lightweight, real-time processing to calculate both **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** and **Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)**, sending immediate alerts if signs of fatigue are detected.

## Project Features

- **Facial Landmark Detection**: The app uses a pre-trained model to identify key facial features.
- **Eye & Mouth Analysis**: 
  - **EAR** determines eye closure duration.
  - **MAR** measures yawning frequency.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: If signs of drowsiness are detected, a visual and auditory warning is issued.

## What's Next

Our team is working on making **Drowsy Driver** more accessible by eventually releasing a hardware solution that can be mounted in vehicles. This device would gather real-time data and alert drivers or family members about potential risks. Stay tuned for more updates!
