With more time, we envision developing a compact device that can be easily mounted on dashboards, catering to concerned family members, friends, and truck drivers alike. Additionally, we plan to gather data from this device to create an application that alerts family members about their loved onesâ€™ safety. Our goal is to enhance road safety and ensure peace of mind for all users.</p>
